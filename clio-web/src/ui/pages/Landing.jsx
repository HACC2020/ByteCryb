                We need your help! The Public Archives of Hawai'i is the keeper of public memory.
                As such, we have millions of records that protect your rights, identity, property
                and history. But given the volume and varying record keeping practicies of the past,
                these records are often difficult or time consuming to find. But with your help, we
                can make finding records a much easier and straightforward process.. Volunteer today
                to help us index these records and join us in connecting the People of Hawai ªi with
                their past, their heritage and their culture!
